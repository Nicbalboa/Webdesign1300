                <h2 class="heading_style">Engine's Role in the 2017 Toyota 86</h2>
                
            <p>
                The FA20 engine plays a central role in the 86's character as a lightweight, agile, rear-wheel-drive sports car. Paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, the engine provides a balance of performance and efficiency, allowing the 86 to be both a fun weekend toy and a daily driver. Its relatively modest power output gives it a more "pure" sports car feel, with great throttle response and the ability to rev freely to its high redline.
