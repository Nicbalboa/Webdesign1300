            <h1> If you're talking about drifting in a 2017 Toyota 86, here's a few things that make it a solid choice:</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Drifting Essentials</h2>

            <section class="col">
                <h2>Drifting Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Rear-Wheel Drive: Essential for drifting, the 86's RWD setup gives you the ability to break traction in the rear wheels and slide the car.</li>  
               <li>Low Weight and Compact Size: The car’s light weight makes it nimble and responsive, which is key when controlling a drift. It also makes it easier to throw into a drift and manage during transitions.</li>
               <li>Manual Transmission: While automatic versions are available, the manual transmission option is ideal for drifting, offering more control over throttle and gear shifts.</li> 
               <li>Balanced Handling: The Toyota 86 is known for its nearly 50/50 weight distribution, making it very well-balanced and predictable. This is helpful when you're trying to maintain a drift for longer periods.</li> 
               <li>Modifications: Many drift enthusiasts modify their 86s with upgraded suspension, better tires, more power (often through turbocharging), and stronger differentials to improve their drifting performance.</li>   
            
               </ul>
            </section>

                   <h3>Safety Requirements</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you’re thinking about taking a 2017 Toyota 86 to a drift event or track, be sure to also think about safety upgrades, like a roll cage, proper seats, harnesses, and possibly a handbrake mod to make your drifting experience more fun and secure.</p>

            <h3>Proper Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Helmet: Always wear a certified motorsport helmet (Snell-rated or FIA-approved) to protect your head.</li>
                <li>Racing Harness: Use a 5 or 6-point harness to secure yourself in the seat, reducing the risk of ejection in case of a collision or roll-over.</li>
                <li>Fireproof Clothing: Wear flame-resistant suits, gloves, shoes, and socks (typically Nomex or similar material) to protect yourself in case of fire.</li>
                <li>Roll Cage: Ensure your car has a roll cage if you plan to drift at a professional or competitive level. It provides protection in case of a rollover.</li>
                <li>Seat and Mounting: Your racing seat should be securely mounted, and designed to withstand the forces during a drift.</li>
             </ul>
