        <h1>Why The Toyota 86 Is A Great Car</h1>
            <p>
                The Toyota 86 is a 2.0-liter,4-cylinder boxer engine.Making 205 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque. Coming in at a weight of
                2800 pounds, this slim compact coupe can take corner like no ones business. This car was not made to race a mustang,
                not made to beat someone in a drag race. This car was made for the hills. With the engine being a boxer, it has a a better
                weight distrubution allowing it to take corners on the track and curvy roads like a beast.
