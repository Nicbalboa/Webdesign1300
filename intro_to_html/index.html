            <p>In the early part of this decade, rumors and speculation about a new rear-wheel drive sports car being co-developed by Toyota and Subaru had reached a fever pitch.
                 Needless to say, enthusiasts were ecstatic about the idea of a new affordable sports car option on the market, and the idea of a car being built for driving enjoyment
                  over fast lap times stood out in a market full of ever more powerful vehicles.</p>

                The Toyota 86 is a 2.0-liter,4-cylinder boxer engine.Making 205 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque. Coming in at a weight of
                2800 pounds, this slim compact coupe can take corner like no ones business. This car was not made to race a mustang,
                not made to beat someone in a drag race. This car was made for the hills. With the engine being a boxer, it has a a better
                weight distrubution allowing it to take corners on the track and curvy roads like a beast.

                This car has technically been realsed since 2013. However it was under another name. Originaly the Toyota 86 was called the FRS. There's also
                another name called the BRZ.Now why are there three different names for this car you might ask? Well Toyota worked together with Sabaru to crate this car.
                The boxer engine is called a FA-20, commonly used by Sabaru in their WRX models. They wanted to realase their own car to sell so both 
                Toyota and Sabaru sold their version of the car seperalty. Both being built the same in terms of specs, but had small cosmetic differneces and interior
                control like the A/C. Toyota owned Scion at the time so had sold it under them as the Scion FRS. With Scion shutting doen on 2016 Toyota finally decided
                to put in in their name called the Toyota 86.
